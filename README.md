# ServiceInNeed
It's a simple structure of a website, where simple services can be provided.
You can create the database using 'migrate' or download the 'sin.sql' file. If you use 'migrate' make sure you have a database named 'sin'.
I've used yajra datatable in this project. So, you need to install it.
This command should install this package, "composer require yajra/laravel-datatables".
Copy paste on any laravel project, and you're good to go.
Enjoy.
